## A genetic Programming Model for detection of Cyberattacks

# Statistics

- 94% of malware is delivered via mail.

- Phishing attacks account for more than 80% of reported security
incidents.

- $17,700 is lost every minute due to phishing attacks
- 60% of breaches involved vulnerabilities for which a patch was available
but not applied
- 63% of companies said their data was potentially compromised within
the last 12 months due to hardware-or silicon-level security breach
- Attacks on Iot devices tripled in the first half of 2019
- Data breaches cost enterprises an average of $3.92 million
- 40% of IT leaders say cybersecurity jobs are the most difficult to fill.

# Objectives

✔️ Attackers have been evolving their strategies and methods with time. Using ML/DL methods will certainly improve their exploitations. Hence developing a model which which fights against such threats is very essential.
✔️ Solving a complex attack has become a very difficult task for security engineers. Hence building a self learning model will enhance the ability to identify and rectify such attacks.
✔️ Attacks happen when the systems are most vulnerable, such scenarios will be guarded by the developed model.

# Intrusion Detection System

- An Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a software application or hardware appliance that monitors traffic moving on networks and through systems to search for suspicious activity and known threats, sending up alerts when it finds such items.
